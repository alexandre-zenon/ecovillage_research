Two main theories from 1990s: 

- Manfred Max-Neef (Human-Scale Development): subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity, and freedom. Needs are universal but need satisfiers are not (eg. need to eat vs. different culinary traditions).

- Len Doyal and Ian Gough (A Theory of Human Need): the universal goal of human activity is “minimally impaired social participation”. Two basic needs (physical health and autonomy of agency) are identified as critical to achieving social participation. Autonomy of agency is further subdivided into mental health, cultural understanding, and opportunities to participate. Similar to Max-Neef, the authors claim that basic needs are universal, but the way they are satisfied may vary depending on institutions and culture. 11 “intermediate needs” : nutritional food and clean water, protective housing, a non-hazardous work environment, a non-hazardous living environment, appropriate healthcare, security in childhood, significant primary relationships, physical security, economic security, safe birth control and child bearing, and basic education.
