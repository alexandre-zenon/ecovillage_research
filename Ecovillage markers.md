- **Bissolotti et al. (2006)** and **Brecher (2013)** emphasize the importance of evaluating the sustainability of ecovillages. They propose various metrics to assess energy consumption, community health, and ecological resilience, suggesting that ecovillages offer important lessons in low-impact living.
- **Brown (2004, 2002)** also contributes to this discourse by analyzing the energy efficiency of co-housing models and how alternative housing arrangements can significantly reduce environmental footprints compared to conventional housing.
