### link to pro-environmental behaviour
Several researchers have proposed that SDT might explain the behaviors of thrift, pro-environmental behavior
(PEB), and VS (Kasser, 2017; Rich et al., 2016; Taljaard & Sonnenberg, 2019). Kasser (2017) theorized that SDT could
explain the positive link between wellbeing and PEB, for example, growing your own food might provide feelings of
competence, working in a community garden might provide feelings of relatedness, and being able to express one's
values might provide for feelings of autonomy. Research by Rich et al. (2016) found a significant positive relationship
between VS and life satisfaction. A study of dematerialization behaviors found that high intrinsic motivation predicted
who avoided buying new items (Whitmarsh et al., 2017). Research into the motivations for adopting VS clothing practices in South Africa found that motivation could be explained by SDT (Taljaard & Sonnenberg, 2019).
