Solutions to global climate cooperation needs:
- sanctions (eg excluding from trade agreement)
- building trust (eg by investing unilaterally in costly mitigation program)
- signaling willingness to reciprocate efforts

Indeed, when pro-environmental action of some is visible, or made visible (eg emoticons to signal whether consumption is below or above average), it leads to better cooperation from others. 

Main message: local social norms are likely to play a prominent part in triggering individual climate-friendly behavior, because these norms appear to be instrumental in explaining some of the observed cooperative behavior
