#### Sustainability and ecovillages
###### Qualitative
Rubin Zach, 2019: Ecovillagers’ Assessment of Sustainability: Differing Perceptions of Technology as a Differing Account of Modernism
-> alternative to dichotomy between either rejecting technology or technosolutionism -> low tech

Plomteux A, 2024: [Frugal abundance: Conceptualisation for degrowth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924001204)
-> definition of a society of frugal abundance: 
- everyone has a good life, 
- consumption is low enough to achieve global ecological and social justice 
- the material wants of everyone are satisfied

Hausmann R & Schwab AK, 2025: [Building a local structural basis for economic change? A case study on grassroots initiatives from a ‘social provisioning’ perspective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924003264?casa_token=eDCURYZqsnsAAAAA:V_OGQpD4NIJYk_9f7yPCeBwd-Am5VPyBbOZNAZ4_nLUxUE6ibCeR0g2c-bDCCS2-u2P0GwCXGTpN)
-> Grassroot initiatives create material, social and cultural structures (eg community-supported agriculture, community banks, production/consumption cooperatives, community energy initiatives, and co-housing communities)
-> based on Social Provisioning Processes theory: SPP proposes studying the economy as the social process of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services with the aim of meeting the needs of those participating in it

###### Quantitative
Rubin Z et al., 2019: Measuring Success in Intentional Communities: A Critical Evaluation of Commitment and Longevity Theories
-> definition of success that incorporates how well communities report satisfaction fulfilling their intentions.
-> the community decision-making structure is more important than any other factor in determining whether communities reports progress toward this metric of success
-> no support for the claim that community age, shared religious backgrounds, commitment mechanisms, or reported egalitarian practices are significant predictors of success in terms of community satisfaction.

#### Wellbeing and sustainability
###### Qualitative
Amsale Kassahun Temesgen, 2021 (PhD manuscript): [Human Wellbeing and  Local-level Sustainability ](https://nordopen.nord.no/nord-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2770954/Temesgen_excl.art.I_II_IV.pdf?sequence=7)
-> changes in foundational principles in communities: 
- from unlimited economic growth to human wellbeing, 
- from atomistic competition to relational cooperation, 
- from instrumental to inherent values 
- from mechanistic to organic worldview
###### Quantitative
Zimmermann J, 2023: [Linking the concept of degrowth and ecovillages – an investigation of German ecovillages ](https://www.schloss-tempelhof.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023_07_07-Master-Thesis-Linking-the-concept-of-degrowth-and-ecovillages-1.pdf)
-> carbon footprint is about half the german average (in 2 example ecovillages, including Siebenlinden)
-> SWB is much higher in ecovillages (around 8 vs 7 on average)
-> higher SWB is mostly attributed to social environment and meaning

Zou T, 2018: Examining Relationships between Social Capital, Emotion Experience and Life Satisfaction for Sustainable Community
-> higher SWB in communities is caused by social capital

Temesgen A K, 2024: [Ecovillage scale-up and its well-being challenges: a case study from Norway](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15487733.2024.2393912)
-> Hurdal ecovillage grew from 10 to 150 but lost parts of its values in the process
-> Needs-based approach (Max Neef)

Gausset Q, Jensen PD, 2024: [Living sustainably in a Danish ecocommunity: how social and physical infrastructures affect carbon footprints](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-024-00113-5.pdf)
-> The SelfSustaining Village in Hundstrup (Denmark)
-> importance of collective choices in making sustainable life possible
-> importance of infrastructures (social --> physical)
-> SSV emits 60% of average GreenHouse Gas emissions
-> better life satisfaction 

Grinde B et al., 2017: [Quality of Life in Intentional Communities
Meaning in life and Social support](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-017-1615-3)
-> online survey (913 members of IC of at least 10 people, taking at least one collective meal per week and having at least 5 years) + hierarchical analysis
-> presence of _Meaning in life_ and _Social support_ were the most important predictors of life satisfaction

#### Ecovillage typology
Escribano P et al., 2020: [A typology of ecological intentional communities: Environmental sustainability through subsistence and material reproduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620318503?casa_token=jvShh5u_0pMAAAAA:-UzxijCDJLT3DrXR1CQfm4YA6qc39EYW64jhZF8qgGuHUksy4kYUuTFNxRseike3opq8NUBSa2mg)

Meijering L et al., 2007: [INTENTIONAL COMMUNITIES IN RURAL SPACES](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1467-9663.2007.00375.x)
