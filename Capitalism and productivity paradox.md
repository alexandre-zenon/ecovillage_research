Insight: how come the emergence of AI is viewed as an economic risk (loosing jobs) when it should only improve our quality of life by taking over tasks that we no longer have to perform?

Observation: 
- Productivity paradox: despite tremendous increases in producitivity along the 20th century, we still work as much as then (on average)

The productivity paradox can be explained by:
- wealth concentration (richest 1% get the benefit) --> decoupling of productivity and wage growth (Between 1979 and 2019, productivity grew by ~70%, but median wages only increased by ~17% (Economic Policy Institute).)
- consumerism, 
- bureaucracy (bullshit jobs), 
- prioritization of growth, 
- increases of costs of housing, healthcare, and education

These are caused by our economic model, based microeconomically and macroeconomically on growth. 

Features of capitalism:
- private ownership of means of production, which leads to profit motive, wage labor, capital accumulation 
- free market for goods and services
- capital and job market
- competition 
- globalization

Those features are thus directly responsible for the productivity paradox. Productivity will never be used to decrease our need to work in such a capitalistic model. AI cannot have beneficial effects for the larger society in this context.
