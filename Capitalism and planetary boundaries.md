Despite our knowledge of the environmental problem and its implications, we fail to act coherently as a society
There are contradictory policies: e.g. trying to develop usage of bikes by building infrastructures, but at the same time, promoting the car industry 

Capitalism and in particular, private ownership of the means of production, leads to mandatory growth and consumerism which makes it impossible to act in coherence with the need to slow down impact on earth.
