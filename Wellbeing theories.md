### Telic theories
main point -->  happiness is gained when some state, such as a goal or need, is reached

Are those needs common to all (Maslow's point of view) or specific to each (Murray). Research seems to contradict Maslow. 

Reich and Zautra (1981) postulated that **personal causation** or **efficacy** is a ubiquitous source of positive affect, and Csikszentmihalyi and Figurski (1982) found that **voluntariness** is a positive aspect of experience. 
Another ubiquitous need:  social support (Campbell et al., 1976)
 Scitovsky (1976) maintained that the correct level of stimulation or novelty increases positive affect.

Goals are conscious whereas needs are mostly unconscious

According to the ** life plan approach**, happiness depends on two key related factors: **harmonious integration of one’s goals** and **fulfillment** of these goals.

Dissatisfied people could be more committed to goals that held the prospect of long-term reward, but that had little short-term reinforcement or enjoyment (Palys and Little, 1983)

Sources of intereference with SWB:
- conflict between short-term and long-term
- conflict between different goals and needs
- absence of goals
- impossibility to attain goals


### Pleasure and pain
"our genetic make-up is such that we are probably happiest when we experience deprivation-based need and are able to satisfy that need" (Houston, 1981)

Basically, there is a relationship between unhappiness and happiness such that one cannot happen without the other. 

Quite weak and unclear overall. 

### Activity theories
 "the activity of climbing a mountain might bring greater happiness than reaching the summit"
  
Theory of flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975): Activities are seen as pleasurable when the challenge is matched to the person’s skill level

### Top-down versus bottom-up theory
bottom-up theory (Locke): happiness is the sum of many small pleasures
 top-down approach (Kant): there is a global propensity to experience things in a positive way, and this propensity influences the momentary interac- tions an individual has with the world
 
 ### Associationistic theory
 Cognitive models of how external events lead to happiness (or not) that insist on the role of associative memory. Each event triggers a series of recalls and the more this network of memories is associated with positive feelings, the more individuals will tend to react positively to all events. 
 
 ### Judgment theories
 Comparison with standard.  In the case of satisfaction, such comparisons may be conscious. In the case of affect, comparison with a standard may occur in a nonconscious way.

In social comparison theory, one uses other people as a standard.
In adaptation and the range-frequency theory, a person’s past life is used to set the standard: Brickman et al. (1978) reported that lottery winners are no happier, and quadriplegics no less happy, than normal controls. They interpreted these findings by suggesting that people adapt to all events, no matter how fortunate or unfortunate.
